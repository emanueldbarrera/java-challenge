# Java Challenge by Emanuel Barrera

### What I did

- First, I did a manual test of the api, using the Swagger tool
- Fixed some bugs I found during manual testing
- Added unit tests with junit5, so that I could code using TDD
- Added custom exceptions

#### What I would like to improve

- Add DTO objects for request and responsses
- Add Spring Security
- Improve javadoc and comments
- Use a logging library
- Add integration tests
- Add e2e tests
- Add cache for the database
- Include a code coverage plugin
- Include sonarqube for code analysis
- Include versioning
- Include support for environments

#### My experience in Java

- I have been using Java since I started my career 9 years ago. (the only exception being the ~2 years I worked at Eventbrite, where we used Python)
- The first framework I used professionally was Grails, for about 2 years. Then my company moved to Spring Boot, and it's the framework I've used ever since.
- I'm using Spring Boot at my current job.
